# This is a big header
## This is a smaller header 

This is just some regular text. Or some **bold** text 

we can insert code chunks with "comand+option+i"

Code chunk is R language. Outside the code chunk is in markdown

message=FALSE supresses output message from loading the package
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

We loaded tidyverse, let's look at some data. 
"storms" is a built in dataset 

```{r}
summary(storms)
str(storms)
```

Let's try making a plot
adding ",echo=FALSE" will hide the code in the chunk  
```{r,echo=FALSE}
storms %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(month), y = pressure, color = wind)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(storms[1:20,], caption = "table made with kable")
```
